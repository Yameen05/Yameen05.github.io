        <section id="goat">
            <h2>The GOAT: Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, has risen from humble beginnings to become one of the most celebrated footballers in history. Growing up in a modest household as the youngest of four siblings, Ronaldo’s early life was marked by financial hardships. His father, José Dinis Aveiro, worked as a municipal gardener and part-time kit man for a local football club, while his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, was a cook and cleaning lady. Despite these challenges, Ronaldo’s passion for football was evident from a young age. He began playing for Andorinha, where his father worked, and later joined Nacional. At 12, he moved to Lisbon to join Sporting CP’s youth academy, marking the start of his professional journey.</p>
            
            <p>Ronaldo’s professional career commenced with Sporting CP, but his breakthrough came when he signed with Manchester United in 2003. During his tenure from 2003 to 2009, he secured three Premier League titles, an FA Cup, a UEFA Champions League title, and the FIFA Club World Cup. His individual brilliance was recognized with his first Ballon d’Or in 2008.</p>
            

            
            <p>In 2009, Ronaldo made a then-record €94 million move to Real Madrid. Over nine seasons, he amassed numerous titles, including four UEFA Champions League trophies and two La Liga titles. He became the club’s all-time top scorer and clinched four Ballon d’Or awards during his time there. </p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>Ronaldo’s subsequent move to Juventus in 2018 yielded two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia. In 2021, he returned to Manchester United for a brief period before transitioning to Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia in 2023. At Al Nassr, he has continued to defy age, consistently topping scoring charts and contributing significantly to the team’s successes. </p>
            
            
            
            <p>Internationally, Ronaldo has been a pivotal figure for Portugal. He made his debut in 2003 and has since earned over 200 caps, becoming the most-capped male player in international football. He led Portugal to victory in the 2016 UEFA European Championship and the 2019 UEFA Nations League, further cementing his legacy on the global stage. </p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>As of March 2025, Ronaldo has surpassed 920 career goals, a testament to his enduring skill and dedication. Notably, since turning 30, he has scored 464 goals, surpassing his tally from his earlier years. His relentless pursuit of excellence continues to inspire fans and players worldwide. </p>
            
            <p>Beyond his on-field achievements, Ronaldo’s influence extends into philanthropy and business. He has been involved in various charitable endeavors, including funding children’s hospitals and supporting disaster relief efforts. His business ventures encompass a range of endorsements and his own CR7 brand, spanning clothing, fragrances, and hotels. In 2020, he became the first footballer and third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career. </p>
            
            
            <p>Ronaldo’s journey from a small island in Portugal to global superstardom is a testament to his talent, resilience, and unwavering commitment to football. His legacy is not just defined by the records he has broken but also by the inspiration he continues to provide to aspiring athletes around the world.</p>

              <h2>How I Play</h2>
              <p>When I play, I love being out on the wing. I’m fast, quick on the ball, and always looking to create something. I try to model my game after Vinicius Jr.—speedy runs, cutting inside, and playing with flair. I live for those one-on-one moments where I can take on a defender, either set up a teammate or go for the goal myself. Nothing beats leaving someone in the dust!</p>
